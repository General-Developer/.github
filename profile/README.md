Actually in this world there are many crazy people, one of them is a developer, yes all developers are good but they don't understand a little about what a library is and why they make a library,

for us a library is a script that is specially designed to make it easier for people to develop a program, but many crazy developers don't know the basic meaning of the library
they make libraries and documents too, but not all of them can be understood / used easily.

Yes we know they are busy and have time to use for other things, and we also know we can be bad but we provide two options (Free & Paid), if you are in doubt before paying you can see our repository and see how to use it along with examples of projects that have used the library we made

Because of the reasons above we GENERAL DEVELOPER, founded this organization to show what a real library is.
